* Tile-based system
** Dimensions
A tile is 32 by 32. Rendered into an 800 by 600 window, that means 25 tiles
horizontal by 18 vertical, with 24 pixels left over for a status bar. In
contrast, the NES provides 32 by 30 tiles.

To maintain the same tile ratio as the NES with 32 by 32 tiles, the game would
need to run at 1024 by 960. If the game instead ran at 512 by 480, 16 by 16
tiles would be needed. 640 by 480 giving 40 tiles by 30 tiles.
** File Format - JSON
JSON has excellent rust support and documentation (unlike, weirdly, TOML.)
** Tile Struct
A tile has a location in the level (in tile coordinates), a type enum entry
(type encoding on-screen appearance,) and a passability vector, that is, a
vector of four booleans, [Up, Down, Left, Right], encoding through what
directions a tile may be passed. Ie if pass_up is true then a character moving
upwards may pass through the tile. However, if pass_right is false, a character
moving right may not pass through the tile.
